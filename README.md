Hi, I’m Tom
- I typically enjoy working on machine learning and computer vision projects.
- I'm currently in the process of converting some of my private repositories to public. Feel free to check back as I continue this process. More to come!

<!---
Tomtom21/Tomtom21 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
